  <h5>Bio</h5>
  <p><b>Hi!</b>, I'm <a href ="https://github.com/jonnydedwards">Jonny Edwards</a>, CTO/CEO of <a href="http://www.temporalcomputing.com"> Temporal Computing</a>, and jobbing data 
  scientist in all sorts of places, mainly now with Neil at <a href="http://www.hippodigital.co.uk">Hippo Digital</a>. My main interests are solving problems using novel
  representations (particularly <em> Unary Codes in Time </em> â˜º) and anything discussed in David Mackay's amazing <a href="http://www.inference.org.uk/mackay/itila/book.html"> ITILA book</a>!</p>
  
  <p>This is a page to gather some of my scientific endevour, I hope you find it useful.</p>

    <h6>Hardware </h6>
      <li>  <a href="html/vizi.html"> Starting with the VIZI-AI</a> <em>(May 2020)</em>  - I met Paul Wealls in an office above <a href="http://paniscafe.co.uk/">Panis cafe</a>, he's a nice guy and 
            I ended up borrowing an early example of some new hardware that utilises the 
            Movidius co-processor.</li>

      <!-- <h6> Information Theory</h6> -->
      <!-- <li> <a href="html/compute1.html">Compression using indexes</a> <em> (June 2020)</em> - I didn't realise -->
      <!-- the significance of order in compressed data, we take it for granted that signal arrive in a sequence. -->
      <!-- Here's we discuss why this is actually a tradeoff, probably alogn the lines of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_principle#Signal_processing"> Gabor Limit </a> .</li> -->
      <!-- <h6> Computation (Especially using time delays)</h6> -->
      <!-- <li> <a href="html/compute1.html">Computing without Logic</a> <em> (June 2020)</em> - temporal computing can simulate logic but there is significant scope to avoid this and -->
      <!-- compute at a higher level. This short article explains this in more detail.</li> -->
      <!-- <li>  <a href="html/madd.html"> A beginners guide to the MADD algortihm </a> <em>(June 2020)</em> - Temporal has patented -->
      <!-- an approach to vector mulitplication - here's a quick dead simple  summary of how the algorithm works -->

      <h6> Machine Learning Methods</h6>
       <li> <a href="html/sammon.html"> An Animated Sammon Map </a> <em>(May 2020)</em> I did this work ages ago and it was used by my friends at <a href="https://www.citizenme.com">citizenme</a>. I like animated
      optimisation processes! </li>
      <li>  <a href="html/tsetlin.html"> The Deterministic Tsetlin Machine </a> <em>(Nov 2019)</em> -
       I  was fortunate to do some early work on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsetlin_machine"> The Tsetlin Machine </a>
       I could see a way round some of the randomisation and  this is the resulting experimentation. 
       I became a friend of <a href="https://www.uia.no/kk/profil/oleg">  Ole Christopher Granmo</a>.
       My views on the algorithm is that it's an extremely useful representation for encoding binary classification rules,
       and offers a significant route to designing an explainable  ML technique.

    <h6> Polemic </h6>

	  <li>  <a href="html/DLMAI.html">AI's a thorny one... </a> <em>(June 2020)</em> I wrote this to try and capture my world-weariness about seeing yet another 
	  Convolutional Neural Thing (CNT) spot areas of coloured and textured pixels at a range of scales. Engineering ... it's easy to be negative.</li>
