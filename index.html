  <h5>Bio</h5>
  <p><b>Hi!</b>, I'm <a href ="https://github.com/jonnydedwards">Jonny Edwards</a>, CTO/CEO of <a href="http://www.temporalcomputing.com"> Temporal Computing</a>, and jobbing data 
  scientist in all sorts of places, mainly now with Neil at <a href="http://www.hippodigital.co.uk">Hippo Digital</a>. My main interests are solving problems using novel
  representations (particularly <em> Unary Codes in Time </em> â˜º) and anything discussed in David Mackay's amazing <a href="http://www.inference.org.uk/mackay/itila/book.html"> ITILA book</a>!</p>
  
  <p>This is a page to gather some of my scientific endeavour, I hope you find it useful.</p>

    <h6>Hardware </h6>
      <li>  <a href="html/vizi.html"> Starting with the VIZI-AI</a> <em>(May 2020)</em>  - I met Paul Wealls in an office above <a href="http://paniscafe.co.uk/">Panis cafe</a>, he's a nice guy and 
            I ended up borrowing an early example of some new hardware that utilises the 
            Movidius co-processor.</li>
      <li>  <a href="html/vizipi.html">  VIZI-AI: part 2</a> <em>(July 2020)</em> - Some more observations on the VIZI-AI. </li>

      <!-- <h6> Information Theory</h6> -->
      <!-- <li> <a href="html/compute1.html">Compression using indexes</a> <em> (June 2020)</em> - I didn't realise -->
      <!-- the significance of order in compressed data, we take it for granted that signal arrive in a sequence. -->
      <!-- Here's we discuss why this is actually a tradeoff, probably alogn the lines of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_principle#Signal_processing"> Gabor Limit </a> .</li> -->
      <!-- <h6> Computation (Especially using time delays)</h6> -->
      <!-- <li> <a href="html/compute1.html">Computing without Logic</a> <em> (June 2020)</em> - temporal computing can simulate logic but there is significant scope to avoid this and -->
      <!-- compute at a higher level. This short article explains this in more detail.</li> -->
      <!-- <li>  <a href="html/madd.html"> A beginners guide to the MADD algortihm </a> <em>(June 2020)</em> - Temporal has patented -->
      <!-- an approach to vector mulitplication - here's a quick dead simple  summary of how the algorithm works -->
      <!-- </li> -->
      
      <h6> Machine Learning Methods</h6>
       <li><a href="html/sammon.html">An Animated Sammon Map</a> <em>(May 2020)</em> I did this work ages ago and it was used by my friends at <a href="https://www.citizenme.com">citizenme</a>. I like animated
      optimisation processes! </li>
      <li><a href="html/tsetlin.html">The Deterministic Tsetlin Machine</a> <em>(June 2020)</em> -
       I  was fortunate to do some early work on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsetlin_machine"> The Tsetlin Machine </a>
       I could see a way round some of the randomisation and  this is the resulting experimentation. 
       I became a friend of <a href="https://www.uia.no/kk/profil/oleg">  Ole Christopher Granmo</a>.
       My views on the algorithm is that it's an extremely useful representation for encoding binary classification rules,
       and offers a significant route to designing an explainable  ML technique.       
       </li> 
       <li> <a href="https://observablehq.com/@jonnydedwards/tripviz">Tripgraph VIZ (via observables) </a> <em>(Oct 2020)</em> - 
      Jon Brassey and I worked tirelessly on a graph search system for the NIHR - it was slightly late (!!) but did 
    wonderful things in combining the variety of network relatedness in the main COVID academic corpus. The work was well received 
  and the above link shows some of the data in a D3 visualisation. </li>
    <h6>Coding </h6>
   
       <li> <a href="html/fountain.html">A brief tour of fountain codes taking in sparsity</a> <em>(July 2020)</em> 
      Fountain Codes are fascinating and have some interesting properties that I've tried to replicate with temporal coding.
      Here's my small review.  
      </li>

    <h6>Temporal Computing</h6>

      <li><a href="html/purity.html">Clockiness</a><em>(July 2020)</em> This is something I wrote for the York non-standard com group, about validity of 
        clocks. Important if that's your substrate.</li>
      <!-- <li> <a href="html/links.html"> <em >Interesting Links ... </em> <a>
-->

    <h6> Polemic </h6>

	  <li>  <a href="html/DLMAI.html">AI's a thorny one... </a> <em>(June 2020)</em> I wrote this to try and capture my world-weariness on the overuse of 
	  the term AI.</li>
