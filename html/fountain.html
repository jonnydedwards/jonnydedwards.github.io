  <h5>Abstract</h5>
  <p>A bluffers guide to fountain codes and the hidden trick which works so well.</p>
</div>


<p>
Fountain codes are a fantastically simple coding scheme with world beating erasure channel 
performance. Erasure channels are like packet channels, where if one (say video frame) 
goes missing then you have to go back and get another to complete the set. Erasure channels, 
as I see them, imply order, that is p1,p2,p3 need to be processed in that order and they are not 
commutative.  
This discussion focuses on one of the key “tricks” of the coding scheme, which is to use a seeded 
random number generator to pass bounded information across the channel divide. The 
interpretation of this material is from the last chapter in the Mackay Information Theory "bible". 
</p>
<p>
So what are fountain codes? As the name implies they are a coding scheme which can reconstitute 
a 100% chunk based on any roughly 105% sample from a stream. So to reiterate that’s <em> any </em> 105%.  
For instance this stream could be a broadcast to a car which whilst going through tunnels misses 
some packets. However, eventually 105% arrives  and voila we have the movie for the kids in the 
back!
</p>

<p>So how does the coding scheme work? We need a few things:</p>

<ol>
<li>A method of superimposing packet data to make a super packet</li>
<li>A method of controlling how many packets are overlaid in a super packet</li>
<li>A method of sending which packets and how many are in the super packet</li>
<li>Finally a systematic method of decoding the super packet</li>
</ol>

<p>So ticking these off in order:</p>
<ol>
<li>Superimposing in a binary context is always done using XOR operations, this is like an addition 
without the needing to  worry about the carry.
</li>
<li>
The soliton distribution - this is well explained in Mackay - it’s a distribution where you 
control the number of packets that go into a super packet, ensuring that some super packets have 
only 1 packet and just enough of these such that in a given random sample enough will be around 
to aid the decoding process.
</li>
<li>
This is the bit I like the most - by seeding and coordinating a random number generator you can 
effectively communicate the number and id of packets in the super packets, across the stream. I like 
this idea a lot for a bunch of reasons, not least because it is a way of communicating order on top 
of an unordered system. You’ll see why I’m interested in the discussion via my attempt at an 
erasure code.
</li>
<li>
The systematic method for decoding is easy to explain once you realise that some of the 
super packets only contain one packet - so are trivially decoded. The trick then is to keep 
removing the packets by XORing, each time exposing “one packet” super packets. This can be done 
in a message passing way but is fairly simple to implement using understanding 
from the above description about the nature of the distribution.
</li>
</ol>

<p>Let’s look at how this plays out diagrammatically:
</p>

<p>
So why am I interested in this given I deal in temporal codes? Well, the main reason is that 
I have a trivial method for doing at least 1 above using the sparse code generated in a 
temporal unary code, and I can use the order/distribution properties, to solve the problem:  
</p>

</figure>

<p>
So there isn’t really any trick involved in this - I simply unary code encode (as per Mackay’s 
definition)  the value and multiplex incrementally in place. I have two choices here, I adopt the 
soliton distribution and the pseudo-randomness to help identify the position of the packets
in the original stream or else I forget this and lose positional information. The latter 
approach is tremendously efficient as it requires no iterative decoding and has a 
capacity to compress as well but at the cost of losing positional information.
</p>
<p>
This highlights the  problem with sparsity,  when multiplexed one loses the concept of order, I’m not 
sure the packet order is 1,6 or 6,1 so I need to encode the order somehow. Sparsity straddles 
the gap between sequential and parallel, with no need for order in a parallel context. The problem 
of encoding order is nevertheless interesting, and something I’m looking into. 
So in summary if you have data that is used sequentially then sparse coding can be used in the place of XOR
in an effective fountain style coding, however if you are in the need of a commutative 
fountain code then sparsity is definitely worth exploring!
