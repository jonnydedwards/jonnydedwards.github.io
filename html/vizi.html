    <h1>Starting With the VIZI-AI</h1>

  <h5>Abstract</h5>
  <p>Getting Started with the VIZI - from a developers perspective.</p>
</div>


<h2> Unboxing and Bootup </h2>

<h3> Initial setup </h3>

<p> My view of this device is it fits nicely as an 
accelerated SBC style device, with this 
in mind initial attempts were to make it useful 
as a standalone. The preliminary goals were </p>

<ol>
<li> Make the systems useful as a functioning SBC </li>
<li> See if I could get a video camera working </li>
<li> Try to get a rudimentary Neural Model working with the movidius </li>
</ol>

<h2> Making it useful </h2>

<p >First off, logging in (root:root),  
plug the network network in and try it out via pinging somewhere 
(I’m not sure where 7.7.7.7 is but it’s become a habit!) and 
then do an update </p>

<pre>
ping 7.7.7.7
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
</pre>

<p> Next steps, set up the windowing environment, you’ll need to also 
setup a new user as once this reboots you’ll need the identity. 
I chose <a href="https://github.com/lxqt">LXQT</a> 
since it’s lightweight (it’s the window manager 
of <a href="https://lubuntu.net/">Lubuntu</a>) 
but looks professional and clean.

Add a user </p> 

<pre>
adduser jonny
</pre>

<p> Add a windowing environment </p>

<pre>
apt-get install lxqt
</pre>

<p> Restart </p>

<pre>
shutdown -r now
</pre>

You should arrive at a screen that looks like this

<p> Login to your icon and you should arrive into the standard LXQT 
windowing environment </p>

<h2>Installing build tools </h2>

<p> The things you need to get things rolling in modern time are 
Git and build tools, you will need to setup sudo access 
(edit  as per). I’ve also installed 
<a href="https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2020.02-Linux-x86_64.sh"> Anaconda </a> 
python in view of the fact that we might be doing some ML type activity. I have a few things 
that make life easier, such as a nice terminal </p> 

<p> git: </p>
<pre>
sudo apt install git 
</pre>

<p> gcc etc </p>

<pre>
sudo apt install build-essential gcc
</pre>

<p> Download Ananconda and install </p>

<pre>
chmod +x Anaconda3-2020.02-Linux-x86_64.sh 
 ./Anaconda3-2020.02-Linux-x86_64.sh
</pre>

<p> Add a simple simple terminal manager as qterminal feels a bit clunky </p>


<pre>
sudo apt install stterm
</pre>

<p> Add micro - it’s lightweight and not vim or emacs </p>

<pre>
curl https://getmic.ro | bash
</pre>

<p> Add htop to monitor stuff and chromium as a basic web browser </p> 

<pre>
sudo apt install htop
sudo apt install chromium
</pre>

<p> Next Checkout  the webcam, I’ve got a microsoft USB camera 
that has worked with many versions of ubuntu, I always try cheese 
first as it handles the video device drivers. I also tried whereby.com 
on chromium 

<pre>
sudo apt install cheese
</pre>

<p> Fire it up from the menu and you’ll see yourself - a good start 
for sensors given that the movidius is primarily there to accelerate 
in the case of machine vision problems </p>

<h2> Installing WIFI </h2>

<p> For a variety of reasons I ended up needing a wifi connection, 
I choose a TP-LINK dongle, which I’m not sure is the easiest route, 
the install is standard device base kernel update, but you need to 
make sure you pull in both the linux source and header files </p>

<pre>
cd rtl8192EU_WiFi_linux_v5.2.19.1_25633.20171222_COEX20171113-0047.zip 
unzip rtl8192EU_WiFi_linux_v5.2.19.1_25633.20171222_COEX20171113-0047.zip 
cd rtl8192EU_WiFi_linux_v5.2.19.1_25633.20171222_COEX20171113-0047
</pre>

<p> and then: </p>

<pre>
sudo apt install linux-source-4.9
sudo apt install linux-headers-4.9
make 
sudo cp 8192eu.ko /lib/modules/4.9.0-12-amd64/kernel/drivers/wireless/
sudo mkdir /lib/modules/4.9.0-12-amd64/kernel/drivers/wireless/
sudo cp 8192eu.ko /lib/modules/4.9.0-12-amd64/kernel/drivers/wireless/
depmod -a
modprobe 8192eu
lsmod | grep 81
</pre>

<p>I fiddled with the WIFI for a while and tried both network manager and  `wicd`, 
which seemed to be the most useful tool and I managed to get connected to my home 
WIFI once the device driver had been successfully registered </p>


<pre>
sudo apt install wicd
wicd-client
</pre>

  
<p> So here’s a picture of my final setup </p> 

<figure>
        <img src="../images/4.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Mountain landscape" width="600" height="400">

<p> I didn’t manage to get anything running on the movidius, 
but I’ll pick that up with the next post </p>
