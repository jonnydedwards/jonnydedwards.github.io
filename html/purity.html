    <h1>A Measure of Oscillator Purity for Computing with Time</h1>

<h1> Introduction </h1>
<p>
The purpose of this short abstract is to describe an initial measure (in a similar vein to <a href="">Yorks paper</a>) 
for the suitability of a medium for computing using clocked oscillations. 
We briefly review the scope for computing in this manner, using a temporally structured
unary coding seen in my original paper. The key requirement for this approach
is pure oscillation, which can be measured using entropy based spectral methods.
</p>

<h1> Simple Temporal Wave Operations </h1>
<p>
Temporal compute methods differ from traditional computation in that the substrate is time. In temporal arithmetic, addition is computed using a concatenation, but differs from the
 digital implementation  described in my original temporal computing paper by using the native oscillation of the signal to clock the output.
Multiplication is then the act of scaling the value against a base frequency. See Figure below for a 
visual explanation. Since the primary substrate is time, the major factors in increasing the speed and accuracy  of computation are 
the oscillator frequency and purity.

<p>    
To measure clock correctness (clockness) we 
perform a simple frequency analysis using the Fourier transform \( Z \int^ \infty _{-\infty} x(t)e^{-jwt}dt \in C\),
examining the magnitude(a) (\(a = \sqrt(Re(x)^2+Im(x)^2)\)). For a single oscillation, this process gives the relative presence of
that oscillation, which can be easily normalised by the total power of
the spectrum (\(N(a_n) = a_n/\sum_i^{maxfreq}a_i\)).
This transforms the spectrum into a probability mass function, which
gives the probability of oscillation at a specific frequency. To turn
this into a measure is then straightforward, we examine the entropy of
the spectrum and <b>a perfect clock will have zero entropy</b>. The
entropy is given by:
</p>

$$
    H(X) = -\sum_{x\in X} p(x)\lg{p(x)}
$$
<p>
This is often referred to as <em>spectral entropy</em>, but here we
are using it specifically to characterise clocks.
The figure below provides some simple examples.

\end{figure} -->

The above scheme is used to evaluate the specific clock property of an oscillating medium, to assess suitability of the medium to conduct temporally 
organised compute.
