    <h1>A Review of Stack Processors</h1>

<h1> Introduction </h1>
<p>
I'm interested in stack architectures as they seem to be a good way of organising the
memory aspect of temporal computing. There's a lot of similaritiues between a stack
and time, not least time operates as a contiuouly popping stack with strict access 
constraints, so as a first approximation their similaritiues are worth exploring.
I have the following questions:
<p>
<ol>
<li>Are stack architectures universal?</li>
<li>Are stack architecrtures efficient?</li>
<li>Are there things that stack architecrures do that time architectures can't?</li>
<li>What happens when you have more than one stack, does this make things more efficient?</li>
<li> WHat has been built with thiese models and can I replicate </li>
</ol>
