    <h1>AI/ML/DL a pragmatic maverick's perspective</h1>

  <h5>Abstract</h5>
  <p>I'm more in the dark than ever about AI - seems to me there's
  currently only <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_typing">Duck typing</a>.
  After reading StJohn Deakin's excellent take on all things AI, I  wanted to get 
  down where I stand on the whole thing!</p>

<h2> Deep Learning </h2>
<ul>
<li> Only suits certain large data problems (vision/speech).</li>
<li> Only suits problems where manipulation of non-platonic concepts prevail
(no symbolic reality... although some work has been done on this).</li>
<li> Largely empirical (other than when Bayes is applied). This gung-ho
is refreshing.</li>
<li> Hardware is the limiting liberating factor.</li>
<li> Upside (big) is it's solving vision/speech problems in the here and now,
 we didn't/don't have any better ideas!</li>
<li> The above plays wonderfully into the hands of large digital corporations and governments, who have the motivation, data and hardware.</li>
</ul>
 
<h2> ML </h2>
<ul>
<li> ML is a well established branch of statistics with known principles
and bounds.</li>
<li> Practically, it can be applied to small data-sets and has application in
many domains, now we routinely collect digital data. In the same way the
web freed text, ML will free data - I mean that both positively and negatively.</li>
<li> I'm not sure anything super new is coming here in improving
classifiers (the workhorse ML approach), it's all been incremental for
a while.</li>
<li> Everybody in this field should have read <a href="http://www.inference.org.uk/itila/book.html">David Mackay's book</a> -
that's not up for argument.</li>
</ul>
<h2> AI </h2>
<ul>
<li> I can't even begin to think how misused this term is, would it be better
if we called this planning/optimisation algorithms?</li>
<li>  I'm pretty certain we can't do artificially "average" tasks yet
(like driving a car ;))- it seems daft
to think we can leapfrog all that foundation and hit the moving target that
is "intelligence".</li>
<li> Bayes is subjective logic, that problem is quite solved. As David
Mackay says  it even explains Occams razor.</li>
<li> I'm not sure we can introspect enough to build AI - I think our human capacity
for understanding ourselves only goes so far, perhaps in the same way
that we find
ourselves with quantum, the closest we'll get is a mathematical
formalism which will
seem unwholesome and unrealistic. I guess the answer is the same:
"shut up and calculate!" </li>
<li> I favour a measure of intelligence that is grounded in the real and practical,
maybe aligned with a biological hierarchy, or key achievable
evolutionary advantages. At least then we can measure progress.
