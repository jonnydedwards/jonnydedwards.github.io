      <description>The whole ML/AI/Deep Learning thing After reading StJohn Deakin&amp;rsquo;s excellent take on all things AI, I wanted to get down where I stand on the whole thing!
Deep Learning  Only suits certain large data problems (vision/speech). Only suits problems where manipulation of non-platonic concepts prevail (no symbolic reality&amp;hellip; although some work has been done on this). Largely empirical (other than when Bayes is applied). This gung-ho is refreshing. Researchers it attracts are low grade scientists (like me), compared to, say, biologists.</description>
