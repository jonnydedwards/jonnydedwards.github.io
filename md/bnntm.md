# Tsetlin Machines are Specialist Binary Neural Netwrks

Within my group of contacts it's fair to say there is a certain amount of 
hype around the Tsetlin Machine architecture - a radical idea with many 
conjectured benefits. In this post I want to draw some parallels with 
existing architectures, for two main reasons, firstly, a negative, to 
show why this technology is incremental rather than radical, second, a positive,
to show that by placing it within the neural context why it may be an important
modification to extend functionality of binary models.

For preliminaries it's worth reading these two papers:


Tsetlin as a neural model.

diagrammatic and mathematical equivalence


deriving a neural style learning rule

presumptions about data rescaling 

some limitations with wide rather than deep 


neural style learning rules
